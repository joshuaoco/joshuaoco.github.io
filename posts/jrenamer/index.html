<main>
<p>I created <a href="https://github.com/Joshuao95/jrenamer">a program</a> to rename files based on simple interpolation of a series of fragments extract first from the files info provided by the OS, and optionally by using Python scripts.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I noticed a common pattern in my computer usage.
I&rsquo;d want to rename a bunch of files based on some arbitrary categorisation and I&rsquo;d just write a little Python script to do it, calculating/scraping/gathering which information I needed for the rename.
This really worked just fine, but each time I&rsquo;d rewrite the actual logic of renaming the files.</p>
<p>I decided it would be nice to extract that out into a tool, while still keeping the flexibility of the Python scripts (because you really really can&rsquo;t beat the speed of a little script for such stuff!)</p>
<h2 id="rust-strikes-again">Rust Strikes Again!</h2>
<p>I really love Rust&rsquo;s ergonomics for so many things, and it really does save you from messing up stuff with its fastidious checking and memory guarantees.
But it does mean that it&rsquo;s always going to be a bit more finicky (even if that finickyness is just hidden from you otherwise).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m convinced of the value of rewriting simple command-line tools in Rust (even though I keep doing it).</p>
