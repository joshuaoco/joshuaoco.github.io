      <description>I created a program to rename files based on simple interpolation of a series of fragments extract first from the files info provided by the OS, and optionally by using Python scripts.
Motivation I noticed a common pattern in my computer usage. I&amp;rsquo;d want to rename a bunch of files based on some arbitrary categorisation and I&amp;rsquo;d just write a little Python script to do it, calculating/scraping/gathering which information I needed for the rename.</description>

I thought it would be fun to automate it, learn a bit about how emojis are represented, and learn a bit about colour mixing.</description>
